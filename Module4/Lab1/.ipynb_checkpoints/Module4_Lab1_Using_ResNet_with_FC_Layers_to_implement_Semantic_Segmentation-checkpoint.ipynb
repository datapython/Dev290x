In other words, by adding additional layers to our existing object classifier network, we are extending its capability to be able to predict the class of each pixel in the input image.\n",

    "For this task, we have again chosen ResNet20 as our base model.  ResNet is configurable in terms of the number of layers, with \n",

    "network to one of the larger configurations, and this is included as an optional exercise for the student.\n",

    "In this tutorial, although we have added layer to ResNet to create a new model, we will train this model from scratch.
