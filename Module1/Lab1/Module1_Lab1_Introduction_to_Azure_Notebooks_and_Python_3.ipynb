    "\n",
    "In this lab, we are going to give you a very basic introduction to Microsoft Azure Notebooks and to Python 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Microsoft Azure Notebooks* (https://notebooks.azure.com/) is a free service that provides *Jupyter Notebooks* (http://jupyter.org/) along with supporting packages for R, Python and F#.  We'll be focusing on Python for the purposes of this course, and using it with the Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit.  Azure Notebooks already contain all the libraries and dependencies you will need to run the labs for this course setup for you.\n",

    "## What is Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics.  It supports modules and packages, encouraging modularity in design, and code reuse. There are two main variants of Python in use currently - 2.x (which an older lineage that is still quite popular), and 3.x (which is the new and improved version of Python).  We'll be focusing on Python 3.5 in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "It also comes with an extensive set of libraries. We'll be using some of these libraries, in particular NumPy in this course. \n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object (and various related objects derived from this, and a powerful collection of routines for fast operation on arrays - including math, linear algebra, statistics and more.\n",

    "The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.  If you plan on running our labs locally, perhaps on a machine acceleratedwith an Nvidia GPU, we recommend the use of the Anaconda distribution of the Python as it may simplify setup for you for Jupyter Notebooks. Follow the link (https://www.anaconda.com/download/) to the Anaconda download page where you can learn more about Anaconda.\n",

    "# Jupyter Notebooks: Important Tips and Tricks\n",
    "\n",
    "A Jupyter Notebook is a very useful tools for mixing documentation (in Markdown) and code (in our case, in Python) in a single online editable notebook. You can run the code, and evaluate its output live in the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you execute code in a Juptyer Notebook, it actually runs in a `kernel` - that is, a small piece of code running either in Azure Notebooks, or locally in your own Jupyter Notebooks server.  The output from this kernel is then rendered in your web browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "The kernel's environment is built up as you run cells of code. Therefore, it is important in many of the labs to run the code blocks in the order they appear in the notebook. Some of these earlier blocks are importing libraries and setting up data structures and variables that will be referenced later in the lab. If you run the code out of order, you might see strange errors. You can always select `Kernel->Restart` to clear the slate if things go funny.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is always the chance that something goes wrong, the Internet connection dies, or the kernel in the backend has a problem.\n",
    "You can try the menu option `Kernel->Reconnect` to see if it is  possible to connect again to running kernel without interrupting computations (but some part of your output may already be lost).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you find the Notebook is becoming fully unresponsive after waiting a significant period of time, you can click on the `Kernel` menu, and select `Interrupt` and try running that cell again. You can also select `Restart` but this will clear the kernel of any memory it had previously, so you will need to start running code from the start of the notebook again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Azure Notebooks are run on individual virtual machines (one per user) that offer approximately 4GiB of RAM and plenty of storage for your notebooks. However, we will be challenging this system with our computational requirements for running deep learning training. There is a chance that you will see occasional `MemoryError` exception messages in your notebooks. If you do, don't panic -- our advice is simply to select `Shutdown` from the main Azure Notebooks page to ensure all kernel processes have stopped. Then, `Restart and Clear Output` on your notebook and try again.  \n",
    "\n",
    "![Shutdown Azure Notebook Kernels](images/shutdown-AzureNotebookKernels.png \"Shutdown Azure Notebook Kernels\")\n",
    "\n",
    "We strongly advise not running multiple notebooks at once in Azure Notebooks, particularly for the deep learning notebooks in Module 3 and 4 of this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Local Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In Azure Notebooks, the libraries containing the actual notebooks themselves are stored on persistent but slow storage. However, there are other paths which are transient (they are lost when the session ends - times out, or is shutdown explicitly, for example) but they are much faster.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In many of the later labs, we will explicitly copy our data sets to these transient areas for speed - but bare in mind they will be lost when the session ends, and thus there is often a setup portion (delay) at the start of each lab. Where this is the case, it will be clearly called out to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Timeouts\n",
    "\n",
    "Your notebook server will automatically be shutdown after a period of inactivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you are in a notebook server, your session is active as long as you are interacting with it - the timeout is set to 60 minutes. If you are inactive for more than 60 minutes, your notebook server will be reclaimed and recycled.  However, your notebooks themselves are safe - you just have to log back in to see them. \n",
    "\n",
    "You may also occasionally see \"Connection failed\" messages if there has been an internet connection issue. \n",
    "The \"Kernel\" menu has several options for interrupting or reconnecting to a stuck kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is comprehensive help on Azure Notebooks available at https://notebooks.azure.com/help/jupyter-notebooks\n"

    "# Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab we introduced Azure Notebooks (which is a cloud-service offering free Jupyter Notebooks) and we introduced Python 3 and NumPy.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this stage, you should feel confident enough to open any of the labs in Azure Notebooks, and to start playing around with them. The concepts covered in the labs will be explained in the related course videos and materials, but please feel free to experiment in the Jupyter Notebooks and get a feel for how these work.\n"
